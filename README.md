# Internship-at-GEBS

Every company must have a leave management system in place,
a software that tracks records of every employeeâ€™s leaves. In order to
ensure smooth operations related to monitoring and managing leave, I was
charged to design and develop a website that automates annual leave
management processes making it simpler for both employees and
employers.
