Every company must have a leave management system in place,
a software that tracks records of every employee’s leaves. In order to
ensure smooth operations related to monitoring and managing leave, I was

management processes making it simpler for both employees and
employers.

    period and the status (approved/rejected or in process).
    
    2- Handling the applications for leave management online.
    
    3- A planning of bank holidays.

Tools used : 
    1-Javascript
